        Hi, I am Diwash Mainali the creator of Dekkoto. This project is my Final
        Year Project for my BSc (Hons) Computer Science bachelors degree. The
        description about the project is given below. Hope you like my project.

        Sharing videos online is a huge part of how we connect today. Sites like
        Facebook, YouTube and Netflix let us watch anything anytime through
        streaming. But as more users stream together simultaneously, and expect
        faster speeds, building systems that can handle massive demand is no small
        feat.
        <br />
        <br />
        This project aimed to develop a next-generation solution for streaming
        through innovative designs, tricks, and network tweaks. The main goal was
        lightning-fast loading regardless of how many viewers with minimum
        server/hardware cost. To pull this off, a super distributed and modular
        backend needs to be crafted for efficient conversion and storage of files in
        the server.
        <br />
        <br />
        Encoding will be tweaked to the max to minimize prep times by splitting work
        into tiny pieces and passing between steps smoothly. Clever caching, load
        balancing, and internet protocols then shipped raw files seamlessly to end
        users lighting fast. Adaptive options tailor quality dynamically depending
        on bandwidth, keeping playback smooth even on bad/normal connections.
        <br />
        <br />
        Compression methods should go through meticulous benchmarking to find the
        best encoding for each content format and resolution. Throughput, CPU usage,
        visuals, and compression ratios were exhaustively profiled to pick the most
        effective codecs. Storage platforms likewise saw extensive prototyping to
        arrive at a scalable organization maximizing retrieval pace for
        uninterrupted serving.
        <br />
        <br />
        By tackling these core technical hurdles through pioneering systems design
        and algorithmic optimizations, the solution should be able to achieve
        unparallel speed, reliability and elasticity.
